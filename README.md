# Parse-BioContainers-Data

This repository contains :

* a notebook which downloads the [BioContainers](https://biocontainers.pro/) data from this adress : https://github.com/BioContainers/containers. Parsers the files, and extarcts for each tool its corresponding tags and summaries. It then saves the structured data into a *.json* file, then deletes the original downloaded BioContainers data.
* it also containes a notebook which does a little study on the capacity of the annotations to cluster the similar tools together
